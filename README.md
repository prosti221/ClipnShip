# ClipnShip
A website that sorts and presents Twitch clips based on who you follow

Pulls a username's follow list from the Twitch API and gives a sorted feed with Twitch clips that are relevant for the user. 
Twitch currently has very poor clip discovery features, which was the motivation for this project.
